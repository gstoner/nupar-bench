The NUPAR benchmark suite targets the modern GPU architectures and tries to utilize the cutting edge features introduced in CUDA and OpenCL.

The benchmarks concentrate on:
Dynamic parallelism
Concurrent kernel execution
Efficient C++11 Atomics
Advanced intrinsic support ( CUDA SHFFLE instruction)
Shared Virtual Memory (Coarse Grain OpenCL 2.0)

In Development:
Shared Virtual Memory (Fine grain OpenCL 2.0)
Unified Memory
Pipes

New Revision Due: March 2015. Stay Tuned.
